### What is it?
A clone of the famous 2048 Android game.
2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Along with two teamates, I attempted to reproduce this game. It has been developed in February 2015.
